# IBM presentation: Introduction to node.js

Thanks to all participants of the lecture!

Review the [lecture slides](https://github.com/Yaakov-Belch/ibm-talk/blob/master/IBM-Node-Lecture.pdf).  
They show the conceptual backbone of the lecture --- without getting into the details of code.

Let's continue the discussion started in the lecture.  There were (at least) two questions that
deserve a better answer than given in the lecture:

* [Please explain the node.js runtime.](https://github.com/Yaakov-Belch/ibm-talk/issues/1)
* [Is node.js appropriate for large applications?](https://github.com/Yaakov-Belch/ibm-talk/issues/2)

Do you have any other questions?  Or any suggestions how I can improve my lectures?  Ask
[here](https://github.com/Yaakov-Belch/ibm-talk/issues).  Please don't believe that your question
or issue is too small to be asked --- or that I would be angry at your criticism.  I **need** your
feedback to continue to grow as a programmer and as a teacher.

If you clone this repository and find that the examples don't work for you --- 
watch [this issue](https://github.com/Yaakov-Belch/ibm-talk/issues/3).

Or --- give me a call at 02-5004362.
